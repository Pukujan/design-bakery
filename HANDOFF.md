# Current Handoff

Start from repository state, not prior chat history.

## Read order

1. `PROJECT.md`
2. `AGENTS.md` when present
3. `checkpoints/CURRENT.md`
4. the active task named by CURRENT
5. the minimum relevant specification/design document

Before editing a GitHub task, run `continuity issue verify <TASK-ID>` and confirm the live issue is open and matches the task.

## Authority

GitHub Issues are authoritative for task scope, priority, ownership, dependencies, acceptance, and lifecycle; the linked task file is a compact working cache. Merged default-branch history is authoritative for accepted code. PR checks and merge evidence are authoritative for delivery. Chat and context packs are derived. Before resuming, verify the linked issue and read current GitHub status.

When a GitHub issue reference appears in a pull-request description or commit message, use a supported issue-closing keyword only when merging should complete that issue. GitHub treats `close`, `closes`, `closed`, `fix`, `fixes`, `fixed`, `resolve`, `resolves`, and `resolved` followed by an issue reference as a close directive; negation does not cancel it. For progress-only work, link with `Refs #<number>` or the GitHub sidebar. After each merge, verify the live issue state before changing task status. See [GitHub's issue-linking rules](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/using-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue).

## GitHub-owned progression

GitHub Issues are required for PCM-governed project work and own task scope, acceptance, priority, ownership, dependencies, lifecycle and durable project progression. Merged default-branch history owns accepted code and normative/domain documents; PR checks and merge records own delivery facts. Checked-in PROJECT/CURRENT/TASK/checkpoint/handoff documents are mandatory versioned projections for task state, not a parallel authority. Local files, registries, context packs and chat are ephemeral execution aids. Domain-document ownership stays with the target project.

Every issue progress update MUST link the leaf child issue that owns the work, its parent ancestry and dependencies (or explicitly none). A top-level deliverable identifies itself as the leaf and says parent: none. Create one child per independently deliverable scope, never one per comment. Record task ID, primary writer and branch on the issue before creating its repository projection. Re-read live issues and relevant source revisions before resuming; the issue verifier checks identity/status, not semantic agreement.

Authorized owner/user direction can revise intent: record it on the owning GitHub issue with a correction/supersession link before dependent work. It cannot alter observed CI/merge facts or waive required gates. Stale projections yield to their field's authority. If direction, ownership or evidence conflicts remain unresolved, pause affected work and record uncertainty; continue independent safe work. One primary writer owns each task branch/checkpoint stream. Coordinate shared-document edits through linked issues/PRs, re-read the current base and reconcile concurrent changes; never force-push or overwrite another writer. Issue prose is not an atomic lock.

Label observed results, repository/external evidence, agent reports and inference separately. Preserve contradictory evidence with source/revision and mark conclusions disputed or unknown until resolved. Append correction/supersession evidence; never rewrite checkpoint history. An upstream correction MUST identify affected descendants and assumptions on their issues; pause, re-plan and revalidate dependent work before resuming. Follow explicit parent/dependency links within the affected scope; cycles or unknown lineage block affected claims. No graph database, local canonical ledger or autonomous polling agent is required.

Before every push, synchronize relevant docs and task/checkpoint projections, CURRENT/HANDOFF when affected, and reviewed catalog/generated index. Record leaf/parent/dependency links, source issue/comment revision, as-of status, evidence, blockers and next action. Commit product/docs first; `continuity checkpoint` then commits and synchronously pushes the checkpoint with a stable request ID. After every successful push, manually publish a leaf issue receipt keyed by request ID and exact pushed SHA, linking changed docs/checkpoint, PR, tests and pending gates; add a linked parent progression update. Retry a missing receipt without another checkpoint/push; inspect for the same key before posting. --receipt-repo and --receipt-issue are opt-in and still require a proven lookup; omit them and the receipt stays manual. Automatic issue-comment synchronization is not implemented; issue #67 is CLOSED (owner freeze decision 2026-09-25) and its unmet guaranteed-completion acceptance transferred to #110.

Required CI and GitHub auto-merge are mandatory. Arm auto-merge only after the increment's final push: a later push races the merge window and strands outside accepted history. Verify protection, required reviews/checks on the exact current-base or merge-queue candidate, and auto-merge; missing, failed, skipped, stale or unverified gates fail closed: no completion or cleanup. After CI/merge, append the exact check results, PR/merge SHA and live issue status to the leaf and link the parent update; fetch and verify accepted history. Reconcile material doc/status corrections in a new synchronized increment. Receipt-only transitions need no recursive doc commit: docs retain an explicit as-of/pending state and point to the live issue. Never label local-only or merely pushed work delivered. Preserve unsafe resources and keep incomplete issues open.

## Issue log format (issue-log-format 1.3.0)

<!-- pcm:policy {"id":"issue-log-format","policy_version":"1.3.0","protocol_version":"0.1.0-draft"} -->

**The issue-log shape is OIO's.** The canonical shape — required fields, lifecycle status, typed relations, and filer provenance — is defined by [`Pukujan/observational-issue-ops`](https://github.com/Pukujan/observational-issue-ops): [`ontology/ISSUE_LOG_ONTOLOGY.md`](https://github.com/Pukujan/observational-issue-ops/blob/main/ontology/ISSUE_LOG_ONTOLOGY.md) is the semantic definition and [`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/observational-issue.yml`](https://github.com/Pukujan/observational-issue-ops/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/observational-issue.yml) is the intake form. PCM does not define a competing form; fill OIO's shape and apply the writing rules below. **PCM owns the writing:** plain language, claim-first evidence, no unexplained acronym or bare identifier on first use, diagrams (mermaid), the reader-first pull-request shape, checkpoint and CURRENT projections, and the closing-keyword rule. **What an investigation record must say** (incidents, failures, research, design issues whose cause is not yet proven): numbered symptoms, each with a bold short name and one observable sentence; hypotheses with **Status** (unverified / confirmed / refuted / inconclusive), **Would confirm**, **Would refute**, and **Experiment**; evidence with provenance that names the hypothesis it supports or undercuts, plus a **Counter-signal** when one exists; an honest caveat; problems kept separate from gaps; and a **Proposal** labelled *(proposal)* that says none of it exists unless named as existing. That is guidance on what the record must say, not a second form schema. **Pull requests open reader-first:** problem and consequence, what changes, how to verify, and what stays unchanged; lineage links; evidence and one next action; long logs collapsed or linked; progress-only references use `Refs #<number>`, and a native closing keyword (`Closes`/`Fixes`/`Resolves #<number>`) only when the merge should resolve the issue. **Diagrams (mermaid):** when a record describes a flow with 4+ ordered steps or 2+ branches, add a fenced mermaid diagram *and* keep an adjacent text list or table so the record survives render failure; default to `graph TD` (vertical) because wide `LR` flows shrink to illegible strips on phones — reserve `LR` for 4 or fewer short nodes; cap 8 nodes and 6-word labels; wrap diagrams that may exceed the container width inside `<details>` (GitHub mounts the renderer lazily on expand); preview the rendered diagram before publishing (broken syntax shows a visible parse error) and never cite renderer URLs as standalone sources. **Readability rules:** the explain-the-reference rule is owned by Content Generation Modules, the single source for issue-log prose voice; read [CGM `docs/NARRATIVE_AUTHORITY.md` Rule 2](https://github.com/Pukujan/content-generation-modules/blob/main/docs/NARRATIVE_AUTHORITY.md#rule-2-explain-the-reference-before-it-carries-weight) rather than a copy here. Write evidence as the claim first, numbers as support (“nothing this change could break failed (263 tests, same six machine-environment failures as before)”), never bare counts; no unexplained acronym or bare identifier on first use in any tier; PR openings and checkpoint Completed/Next lines start with one problem sentence a newcomer can follow; the rule set applies to CURRENT projections and checkpoint entries exactly as to issue logs. No private absolute paths or secrets; link rather than paste long logs. See `docs/ISSUE_LOG_FORMAT.md` for the full format, exemplar, and examples.

## Continuity path naming

New continuity-managed source paths (tasks, claims, adopter folders, new prose filenames) use pronounceable words a newcomer can say aloud. See `docs/CONTINUITY_PATH_NAMING.md`. Keep existing public paths stable; do not rewrite merged history for naming alone. Generated artifact/media filenames belong to CGM ([content-generation-modules#26](https://github.com/Pukujan/content-generation-modules/issues/26)) — pin and apply that helper when generating content; do not reimplement it in PCM.

## Docs travel with the code

A pull request that changes code must also update a `README.md` (any folder's) or a doc under `docs/`, `additionals/doc/` or `additionals/guidelines/`, or `HANDOFF.md` / `AGENTS.md`. CI enforces it (`.github/workflows/docs-check.yml`, `scripts/check-docs-updated.mjs`). Task and checkpoint notes and lockfiles do not count either way. When nothing needs documenting, add the `no-docs-needed` label or a body line `No docs needed: <why>`; editing the body re-runs the check.

## Workspace mode: single checkout

Use the main checkout for sequential work. Do not create clones or linked worktrees. This is the strictest and simplest option when parallel isolation is not needed.

## Finding earlier project documents

When `.continuity/documents.json` is present, it is the machine-readable inventory and `docs/CONTINUITY_INDEX.md` is its generated human view. Every fresh session or task takeover/resumption must consult the inventory before choosing its next action, not only before writing a document: run `git fetch origin`, then use `continuity docs find "<issue title and task-objective terms>" --task <TASK-ID>` and read matching records and their declared neighbors. The search is deterministic metadata search, not semantic whole-repository search. `continuity validate` checks the generated view; use `continuity docs render` to refresh its freshness labels after source edits. A `NEEDS_REVIEW` result preserves historical evidence but says not to rely on it without checking the current file.

## Continuity records

<!-- pcm:policy {"id":"continuity-records","policy_version":"1.3.0","protocol_version":"0.1.0-draft"} -->

Write continuity issues, updates, pull requests, and project-state documents so a fresh reader can understand the problem, human outcome, scope, evidence, and next action. Cite external claims and link repository claims to a revision or CI result. Include reproduction detail only when needed to verify the claim. Keep PR openings skimmable; link long logs. Do not claim automatic tracker synchronization or chat capture unless implemented and tested.

## Degraded continuity

Execution safety and existing authorization outrank continuity bookkeeping. If a canonical continuity file is temporarily unavailable, do not stop safe work, repair storage just to force a checkpoint, or ask again for an already-authorized host/worktree. Use an authorized alternate checkout and run `continuity checkpoint <TASK-ID> --root <canonical-root> --recovery-root <alternate-root> ...` to write a JSON recovery receipt under `.continuity/recovery/`; do not create an ad-hoc Markdown checkpoint or replace the alternate task file. Reconcile it into the canonical task with `continuity recovery reconcile --root <canonical-root> --file <receipt>` when writable. The repository/task lineage is authoritative; a physical path is not.

Normal checkpointing is a delivery operation, not a local note: commit the product change first, then run `continuity checkpoint`. The command prints a `REQUEST_ID`, commits the canonical checkpoint and synchronously pushes the task branch to `origin`; if interrupted, rerun with the same `--request-id` to avoid a duplicate (changed payload with the same ID is rejected). Open or update a PR after pushing. GitHub CI and auto-merge then run asynchronously and wait for required reviews/checks and any merge queue. Confirm the merge before marking the task complete or removing its worktree.
