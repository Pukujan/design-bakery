"""design-bakery's voice call agent on LiveKit Agents: it hears and speaks; the copilot in the visitor's page decides.

Copied from pukujan-lab-2/voice-agent-research (demo/live-site/speech/agent.py at 67432b8) and kept here (TASK-DB-0137), so the
site's calls can be tuned without touching the copilot lab. It registers as AGENT_NAME (default design-bakery-voice) and only
joins rooms whose token asks for it (backend/src/copilot/voiceToken.ts); the lab's unnamed agent never joins those rooms. On top of
the lab's version, so other people in the caller's room are not answered (voice-agent/README.md):
  Hush (hush.py) takes background voices and noise out of the caller's audio before anything hears it;
  the voice match (voiceprint.py) learns the caller's voice and drops turns in anyone else's, the copilot's own echo included;
  a short line the recogniser was unsure of is dropped too; a stricter voice detector and a longer barge-in.
  A dropped turn reaches the page as copilot.ignored (shown greyed, with "answer this"; agent.claim says it was the caller's),
  and is an empty transcript to LiveKit, so a reply it talked over carries on (a false interruption).

  caller's browser ──WebRTC──► LiveKit server (local, dev mode) ◄──► this worker
    Silero VAD + LiveKit's turn detector end each turn and handle barge-in (the caller talks over the voice);
    LocalSTT / LocalTTS call speech/server.py with the call's voice stack (stacks.json, docs/decisions/0012):
      english-fast  Parakeet to listen, the English turn detector, Pocket TTS to speak
      multilingual  Whisper large-v3-turbo, the multilingual turn detector, Kokoro in the caller's language
      lfm3-audio    LFM3-Audio hears and speaks (one model on llama.cpp), turns end on voice activity alone
    The page puts the stack server.ts picked and the caller's language on the caller's participant attributes
    (copilot.stack, copilot.language); a language changed mid-call takes effect from the next turn;
    the decision step is the copilot engine in the caller's page (widget/sdk.ts), reached over LiveKit RPC:
      copilot.greet  -> the short spoken intro          copilot.turn {text} -> the reply to speak
    so read-backs, never-submit, quote-only answers, verification and page actions all stay in the engine.

Every turn goes to Phoenix through Octo (telemetry.py), in the page's call session: what was heard, and from the
moment the caller stops talking, the end-of-turn wait (VAD and turn detector), STT, the engine's decision (which includes
any library search) and the voice's first audio; barge-ins, failed RPC calls and speech errors too. A watchdog
(stall_watchdog.py) logs a stall (the caller spoke and no turn came of it) as an error span and starts the turn over.

Run: voice-agent/.venv/bin/python voice-agent/agent.py dev   (with Hush: the Dockerfile; voice-agent/README.md)
